# PiCraft
An easy to use installer to setup a minecraft server on the Raspberry Pi

# What is it?
PiCraft allows you to easily setup and install a minecraft server on the Raspberry Pi.
We know that there is also the [Pinecraft](https://github.com/Cat5TV/pinecraft) project that has also been made for the same purpose, but there are some differences between Pinecraft and PiCraft.

# Differences between [Pinecraft](https://github.com/Cat5TV/pinecraft)
## Pros
* Allows different types of servers
* Advanced user panel
* Custom server jar
* RAM Optimization

## Cons
* Work in progress

# Server Support
PiCraft allows you to supply your own server.jar or download one automatically. PiCraft can automatically download

## Bukkit Forks
* Spigot
* Paper
* Purpur

## Modded Servers
* Fabric
* Forge

We plan to add others in the future but if you don't want to wait use the advanced panel and supply the server.jar there!
