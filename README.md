#### I'm back! PCX should get weekly updates now

# PineCraft X
An easy to use installer to setup a minecraft server on the Raspberry Pi

# What is it?
### PineCraft X is a project I made because when I was young and I wanted to create a minecraft server for me and my friends to play on, I saw on a youtube video about [Pinecraft](https://github.com/Cat5TV/pinecraft) and that a Raspberry Pi was the best way to make a server for free. But, when I bought it I found out that [Pinecraft](https://github.com/Cat5TV/pinecraft) was bad at creating servers with customizability and I dropped it. Now that im older and I know how to code, I decided that anyone should be able to create a minecraft server no matter their skill, and thats why I created [PineCraft X](https://github.com/deezed420)

# Differences between [Pinecraft](https://github.com/Cat5TV/pinecraft)
## Pros
* Allows different types of servers
* Management Panel
* Easy to use CLI

## Cons
* Work in progress
* Small popularity

# Server Download
PineCraft X can automatically download most popular minecraft server jars. Below are the server jars that we can automatically download for you. Note: If you want vanilla
functionality so that farms work, choose Fabric as Spigot, Paper, and Purpur have
patches for most of these farms.

## Bukkit Forks
* Spigot
* Paper
* Purpur

## Modded Servers
* Fabric

* Deezed420 (For creating the entire program)
* Pollev (For the [progress bar](https://github.com/pollev/python_progress_bar) that we use)
