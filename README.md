# PineCraft X
An easy to use installer to setup a minecraft server on the Raspberry Pi

# What is it?
PineCraft X allows you to easily setup and install a minecraft server on the Raspberry Pi. It allows a lot of customizability and allows as many servers as the Pi can handle!
The project we based ours off of is [Pinecraft](https://github.com/Cat5TV/pinecraft). We noticed it doesn't have that much functionality, so we made it better.

# Differences between [Pinecraft](https://github.com/Cat5TV/pinecraft)
## Pros
* Allows different types of servers
* Advanced user panel
* Custom server jar
* RAM Optimization

## Cons
* Work in progress
* Small popularity
* May be buggy

# Server Download
PineCraft X can automatically download most popular minecraft servers or you can give a custom server jar. Below are the server jars that we can automatically download for you

## Bukkit Forks
* Spigot
* Paper
* Purpur

## Modded Servers
* Fabric

We plan to add more support in the future, but if you can't wait then you can supply a server jar.

# PineCraft X Support
We have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/HhtjQU3GZr), but know that this support server is not for support related to minecraft, only for support with PineCraft X.
